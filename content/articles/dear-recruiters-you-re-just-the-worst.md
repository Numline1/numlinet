I've been in the software engineering industry for over 10 years. I've met with dozens of recruiters, hiring agencies, HR representatives - all sorts of people and companies. All of these experiences were vastly diverse, ranging from great and relaxed business chats to "why in the hell am I still sitting here" types of onset existential crises. What made the difference?

Well, let's start with the word **recruiter**. If you're a person that's responsible for talent searches, hiring or general people management, please stop calling yourself a recruiter. The word **recruiter** has its origins in the military, if you're interested, the Etymonline dictionary has an [extensive origin definition](https://www.etymonline.com/word/recruit) for it.

## Why is that a problem?

As a random inspirational post liked by a concerning amount of people on Instagram says: "Words can inspire. And words can destroy. Choose yours well.". Presenting yourself using a word that describes a person finding people for the military straight-up sets the tone of our relationship before we even get a chance to talk. It implies that I, as an engineer, am inherently **interested in** or **desperate for** what you're offering. Well guess what - I'm not. Most of us just don't care about your vague job descriptions and your generic approach to candidates. Stop wasting your time and stop wasting mine.

Switch to **candidate sales**.

You should be the ones trying to sell your product - your job listing. Many of us already have jobs, many of us are happy in our positions and your boring listing is not going to change that. Be creative, give us a reason to consider talking to you, throw some glitter in. It's just a simple wording change, but it makes a world of difference.

## Junior and non-technical recruiters

I get it. You're not a developer, perhaps you're not even a tech person. That's okay, but do some damn research before you start spamming my inbox. You might feel that bombarding 1000 people your LinkedIn Premium spits out might give you outstanding results, but I guarantee you that any JavaScript developer with a sliver of self-respect is not going to message you back if you throw a "Senior Java developers needed" listing at them.

I've had countless messages and e-mails presenting a C# position in godknowswhere Pakistan or some PrestaShop scripting positions for $5 an hour. I've never done C#, never mentioned having any experience in it and I'm most certainly not about to start fixing your puppy socks selling e-shop made by your neighbors son that "fixes printers and does websites". Know your audience.

## The "minimalists"

I'm a busy person. I have a full-time job, several side projects, family to visit, plants to water, movies to watch. Remember that part where I said you should stop wasting my time? As it turns out, at a certain point in the hiring history, it became an industry standard to provide minimal or no information about the job or the company you're "recruiting for" during the initial contact.

As I've said, the position you're trying to fill is your **product**. Would you buy a product that has no description, no brand and no calorie information? If you're messaging me and your first message doesn't contain any information about the company, team size, contract type or salary, I no longer care. I'm not messaging you back. Keeping the company name a secret makes me feel like you're trying to withhold information. The missing salary range makes me think I'm about to waste hours interviewing for an unpaid internship.

Good afternoon, Mr. Krajcovic.

I'm a headhunter and your LinkedIn profile caught my attention.

I'd like to get your attention regarding PHP position offers for my two clients.

Would you be interested? Can you send me your current CV?

We can then agree on further steps.
```

Ok, I might hate the word **headerhunter** more than **recruiter**. Leave my head alone.

## Leave your ego at home

I'll start this one with yet another example:

```
Dear Martin, 

The Backend Developer must have the following Frameworks/Technology:
‚Ä¢	+5 years of experience as a Backend Developer  
‚Ä¢	Proficient in NodeJS
‚Ä¢	Background in either Java, C# or PHP
‚Ä¢	Knowledge of Kafka or other messaging queuing mechanisms like RabbitMQ, Restful API specification, GIT, Unit Testing, Kubernetes and Docker. 
‚Ä¢	Fluency in English 
‚Ä¢	Knowledge of design patterns(gang of four), 
‚Ä¢	Domain Driven Design, experience with AKS(Azure Kubernetes), 
‚Ä¢	Experience with Performance and Load testing scenarios in high-availability solutions/platforms 
‚Ä¢	Experience in working with and for Enterprise organizations.

The conditions of the Backend Developer mission are as follows: 
‚Ä¢	Start: January 
‚Ä¢	Remote work possible 
‚Ä¢	Rate: Competitive 
‚Ä¢	Interviews: November/December
```

Look, I'm not trying to be a special snowflake here. There's people out there who've achieved much more than I could ever dream of achieving. I leave my ego at home. This e-mail I've received managed to destroy my beliefs in common sense, any recommendation mentioned above and set the bar so low, I couldn't even believe it's real.

Starting our first communication with the words "must have" and providing absolutely no detail about yourself or the company you're representing is a ballsy move. I'm all about the **KISS principle** (keep it simple, stupid), but that assumes you actually provide the *simple* part. This lovely person provided nothing.

Sure, you could argue that the potential hire has all the information of **what** the hire will be working with, however it came short on **who** they'll be working for. Spoiler alert: Most of us are not soulless code monkeys.

Oh, and by the way, you're looking for a person with a background in either "PHP, C# or Java" - what kind of hell spawn are you building at your company? And what do you mean by "experience in working with and for an **Enterprise organisation**"? Is that considered to be a skill these days? Great selling points!

So to sum up - no, I don't have to have anything you've just listed. I don't even know you and I already don't like you. How about the next time you directly contact me, you actually provide something that might make me want to stay in touch with you instead of making me want to block you and cancel my internet connection.

## The overly excited and "hip" recruiter

You know who you are. You never forget to mention you're a young **collective** of people (just use the word "company"). You're like a **family** (no, you're not, get real). You have a **ping-pong table** and **beanbags** in your office, you do regular **teambuildings** and have a fancy **coffee machine**.

Unfortunately, so does any other company in the world. Don't get me wrong, listings like this are certainly a step up from anything mentioned so far, but it's still not stuff any experienced engineer cares about. There's nothing wrong with having or providing any of these things, but it certainly doesn't have that "wow" effect you're going for.

Extra special cringe points go to recruiters that include outdated (T -1 year, at least) memes in their listings. "Haha, PHP apps go brrrr, amirite guys?" - Shut up.

## The "self-destructive" recruiter

This is a strange and, thankfully, rare specie. Even though I mentioned many flaws recruiters can have in the previous paragraphs, we, people being hired are certainly not perfect either. I can't imagine the amount of terrible CVs, lacking social skills or just oversold candidates an average recruiter has to go through. That's fine, I respect that, you can provide a constructive feedback and honestly, I can't even blame you for giving up on candidates completely.

There's however the opposite extreme - nit picky recruiters. There's absolutely a considerably high amount of introverts or socially awkward people within our ranks. You absolutely have a right to analyze my behavior. After all, you're trying to find someone that'll fit within your existing company structure, someone who's responsible, friendly and hard-working. But it's easy to take it too far, overthinking how your potential candidates answer the phone (note: this is a LinkedIn post from a recruiter about random initial screenings):

```
Helloooo? Who's calling?

Phone screenings became an efficient and practical way on how to check the information in CV and how to make the first impression on a potential employee.

How do you introduce yourself on the phone‚ùì I admit, I always feel it seems nice and professional when the candidate says Hello and introduces themselves by a name.

How to be impressive during a phone screening ? (details are important, even though they may seem obvious üòÄ )

‚úÖ greeting and introduction
‚ùå avoid "Hello" "yes?" "Hello, who's calling?"
‚úÖ smile - positive energy can be felt from the voice
‚úÖ be brief and concise
‚úÖ be ready for questions like "why did you react to this listing, your current job scope and why did you leave your last job?
‚úÖ don't be worried to ask to postpone the call
```

There's so much wrong with this (besides the obvious overuse of special emojis). No sane and privacy-concious person is going to introduce themselves to an unknown number. Have you ever heard about spam and phone scams? Do you really have the benefit of sorting people based on such bullshit?

## But how do I do candidate sales well?

This is all subjective, so in the end, you do you, but:

* Start thinking the way the person you're hiring might think. Avoid things mentioned in this article.
* Change your mindset and stop being a recruiter. Transition from human resources to human relationships. Go from recruitment to **candidate sales**.
* Keep your potential employee interested. Mention **who you are**, who you're **hiring for**, mention the **technologies** you're working with, mention the **impact** you or your customer are hoping to have on your industry. Mention the team and **people** you're hiring for. Mention the **salary**. Mention the contract and possible **working arrangements**.

Wanna see all this in practice? This is the perfect candidate sales message I'd love to see:

```
Hello Martin,

my name's John and I'm currently partnering with Madeupsoft to find a person for their engineering team in Switzerland.

They're working on a video-streaming platform for schools and educational institutions. They're using Laravel for the backend,
React for their frontend and a serverless architecture on AWS. This team of 8 people is looking for a senior full-stack engineer
experienced with large-scale applications, containers and clean code.

This position can be either fully remote or onsite. Offered salary is around $30k/year but flexible depending on your seniority.

Tech details can be found on [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/companies/madeupsoft) and their product info, company structure and team
details are available on [their website](https://example.com).

I'd be happy to schedule a quick call with you to go over the details if you're interested!

Best regards,
John
```

Is that really so difficult? I can see everything I need in several sentences, I know what company to stalk on Google, I know what technologies they use (and inherently their skill range based on their decisions) and I know I won't have to sell my car if I apply.

## Closing words

The purpose of this article wasn't to spread hate or to insult anybody. And even though I'll certainly end up on some blacklists, I'm hoping this'll help at least some people with the way they operate in the future. Kudos to you if you understand this is about a feedback and not about pointless criticism.
